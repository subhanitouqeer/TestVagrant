# TestVagrant
This is a sample repo for RCB Team Json Validations

Tech Stack Used:
1. Java
2. Cucumber
3. Serenity-BDD
4. JUnit

Serenity is used for reporting purposes and you'll find the report under the "Target/site/serenity" directory, in the "index.html" file.

NOTE:
Since there were no endpoints given, the json file was treated as a response and the required Validations have performed keeping this pre-requisite in mind.
